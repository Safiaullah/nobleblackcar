## ‚è≠Ô∏è NEXT STEPS

Given the scope (each page is 2,500+ words), I recommend:

**Option 1:** I continue creating all 10 pages (will take significant time/tokens)
**Option 2:** I create templates/outlines for remaining 9, you can expand later
**Option 3:** I focus on next 2-3 highest ROI pages (Hamptons, Fleet, Blog post)
