## üéØ Why Google Business Profile is Critical

Google Business Profile (GBP) is **THE MOST IMPORTANT** local SEO factor for your black car service:

- **70% of customers** find local businesses through Google Maps
- **Show up in Local Pack** (top 3 map results above organic listings)
- **Get phone calls directly** from search results
- **Display reviews** prominently in search
- **Free advertising** on Google Search and Maps
