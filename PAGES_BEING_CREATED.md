# All 64 Pages - Creation in Progress

## Status: CREATING NOW

I'm building all 64 pages with:
- SEO-optimized content (800-1,200 words each)
- Proper meta tags and schema markup
- Internal linking
- Call-to-actions
- Mobile-responsive design

**Total pages to create:** 63 (excluding Teterboro which is done)

**Estimated total content:** ~60,000 words across all pages

**This will take multiple file creation operations. Creating them now in batches...**
