   - Shows you care about customers

5. **Post 3x per week minimum**
   - Active profiles rank higher
   - Keeps your business top-of-mind

### The "Quick Wins" (Easy Impact)

1. **Get first 5 reviews from friends/family**
   - Establishes social proof immediately
   - Easier than cold outreach

2. **Use professional photos**
   - 42% more engagement
