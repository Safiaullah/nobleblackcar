                You can book a ride three ways:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700">

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                For best availability, we recommend booking 24-48 hours in advance. For airport transfers, corporate events, weddings, or specific vehicle requests (like our Mercedes S-Class or Sprinter van), booking 2-3 days ahead ensures your preferred vehicle is reserved. However, we accept last-minute bookings based on availability and often can accommodate same-day requests.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes! Round trip bookings are common and often more economical. When booking, simply provide both pickup and return times. For airport pickups, we'll track your return flight to adjust for any delays. Round trips are particularly popular for:

                Yes! We monitor all flights in real-time using advanced flight tracking technology. If your flight is delayed or arrives early, your chauffeur's pickup time automatically adjustsâ€”no need to call us. This ensures your driver is there when you land, not when you were scheduled to land. Just provide your flight number when booking.

                <strong>Airport pickups:</strong> 60 minutes of complimentary wait time from the moment your flight lands. This gives you time to deplane, collect luggage, clear customs (for international arrivals), and reach the pickup area without any rush or extra charges.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Are your chauffeurs licensed and insured?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes. All chauffeurs are TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) licensed, commercially insured, and background-checked. They undergo defensive driving training, customer service certification, and must maintain clean driving records. Our chauffeurs are professionals who know the area, dress in business attire, and provide courteous, discreet service.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Can I request a specific chauffeur?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Absolutely. If you've had a great experience with one of our chauffeurs, you can request them for future bookings. While we can't always guarantee availability, we'll do our best to accommodate your request. Many of our corporate and regular clients develop preferred relationships with specific chauffeurs.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Do you provide car seats for children?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes, we provide complimentary car seats and boosters upon request. When booking, please specify the age and weight of children who need seats so we can provide the appropriate type (infant seat, convertible seat, or booster). New York law requires children under 8 to be in appropriate car seats, and we ensure full compliance.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Is smoking allowed in vehicles?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                No, all our vehicles are smoke-free environments to ensure comfort for all passengers and maintain the pristine condition of our fleet. This includes traditional cigarettes, cigars, and electronic cigarettes/vaping devices.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Can I make stops along the way?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes! For point-to-point service, brief stops (5-10 minutes) can often be accommodated at no additional chargeâ€”just let us know when booking. For multiple stops or longer wait times, we recommend booking hourly/as-directed service which gives you flexibility for as many stops as you need during your reserved time.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">What happens if there's traffic or road closures?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Our experienced chauffeurs monitor traffic conditions in real-time and use GPS navigation to find the fastest routes. We build buffer time into airport pickups and recommend booking with extra time for important events. If unexpected delays occur, your chauffeur will communicate with you and adjust the route. For flat-rate services, the quoted price remains the same regardless of trafficâ€”no surge pricing.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes, meet and greet is standard for all airport pickups at no extra charge. Your chauffeur will be inside the terminal (baggage claim for domestic, arrivals hall for international) holding a sign with your name. We'll send you their contact information and photo before your arrival so you know exactly who to look for.
