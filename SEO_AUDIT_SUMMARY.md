## ❓ FAQs

**Q: How long until we see results?**
A: Quick wins (reviews, basic optimization) in 2-4 weeks. Meaningful traffic in 3-6 months. Full results in 6-12 months.

**Q: Can we do this ourselves?**
A: Yes! The roadmap is detailed enough to follow in-house. Hiring a copywriter and SEO consultant will accelerate results.

**Q: What's the ROI?**
A: SEO typically delivers 10-20x ROI over 12-24 months. For black car services, even 50 additional monthly bookings from organic traffic would justify the investment.

**Q: Why aren't we ranking now?**
A: You have a great technical foundation but insufficient content targeting the right keywords. Competitors have more pages, more content, and more backlinks.

**Q: What if we can't afford the full roadmap?**
A: Start with Phase 1 only. Fix technical issues, create 7 critical pages. This alone will drive results. Scale up as revenue grows.
